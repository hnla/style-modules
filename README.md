# Style Modules - Buddypress styling Library Snippets
**BP Style Modules - a test repo to explore the proposed style library for the BuddyPress project**
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Test repo dev comments**
This repo explores how the proposed Style Modules might be organized on the BP repo.
The Project proposal was written up and published to BuddyPress's bpdevel site:
(https://bpdevel.wordpress.com/2016/03/30/bp-style-modules-a-proposal/)

This repo contains one module directory and some further dummy examples for show. The ultimate purpose of the repo is to maintain the modules as seen in the repo _not_ to clone the the repo or download the repo (unless ones in initial core dev work) Module authors and users would be submitting and downloading the individual module folders and files. This process as it would be setup and run on github is not decided on at this stage.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The section below is the first pass and in progress repo instructions for authors and users.
Author guidelines for submitting and formatting etc will be here for reference.
User instructions for downloading and installing a module will be here in detail to help facilitate
loading along with copy/paste file enqueueing examples.

# BP Style Module authoring guidelines & installation instructions

## Authors Guidelines:

All submisions are made by creating a ticket on trac.buddypress

Upload your folder(files) complete with SC & readme.md

Add a brief decription of your submissions styling purpose e.g _"styles the user message tables..."_ 

A core BP dev  will download your submission and run a basic check for formatting standards and error free code, when two devs have signed off on the submission it will be uploaded to the BuddyPress repo.

**Updates**

Authors are responsible for maintaining their modules against BP release cycles, ensuring that their module still performs as expected for new BP releases.

## Module Installation Instructions:
